Certificate Authority in ERlang - erlang implementation of TCG's privacy certificate authority

Caer is Welsh meaning "stronghold" or "fortress".  It is used as a pre-fix as in "Cair Guiragon". "Caer" is also a sub-string of the title "pCA in ERlang" (privacy Certificate Authority in ERlang), or can be alternatively remember as CA in ERlang (Certificate Authority in ERlang), although the project does not, presently, aim to be a general purpose CA, but rather shall focus on TCG transactions for remote attestation.

Since the server shall issue and hold certificates used for security, the name is quite appropriate.
