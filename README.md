Certificate Authority in ERlang - erlang implementation of TCG's privacy certificate authority

Caer is Welsh meaning "stronghold" or "fortress".  It is used as a pre-fix as in "Cair Guiragon". "Caer" is also a sub-string of the title pCA in ERlang.  Since the server shall issue and hold certificates used for security, the name is quite appropriate.
